# fideligard-stock-simulator
Fideligard lets you 'slide' through time and make stock investments to practice your ability to predict future market price fluctuations (Buy low, sell high).

Fideligard is a AngularJS JavaScript single-page web application using services, directives, ui-router, and good modular code to create a stock portfolio simulator using Yahoo's finance trading data.
